<!-- 

Create the missing the code such that you can retrieve the requested item from the theCobWeb object.

Note: This exercise is actually very relevant to work as a web developer, as data is often relayed across websites in the form of deeply nested JavaScript objects like this one.

Bonus: If you finish early, begin pondering the bonus item. This is a very challenging exercise. It's impossible to complete in the allotted time. If you're feeling valiant - complete it outside of class and come back to instructors/TAs to go over it. This will arm you for difficult interview questions in the future.
